# Beko IT Budget Control & Compliance Portal

## Overview

This project is a web portal developed for the IT Budget Control & Compliance department at Beko. The portal streamlines budget control and compliance processes, providing efficient tools for daily tasks, comprehensive reporting, and significantly reducing processing times for Excel-based tasks.

## Features

- **Budget Control & Compliance Management**: A centralized platform for managing and overseeing budget control and compliance requirements.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: The portal automates routine tasks, enabling employees to work more efficiently and effectively.
- **IBM Cognos-like Reporting Capabilities**: Provides detailed reporting features to support budget control, similar to IBM Cognos, ensuring compliance and transparency.
- **Time Efficiency**: Optimizes the time spent on Excel tasks, reducing it from 6 hours to 1 minute for file processing.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Since most of the tasks are performed on Excel files, the backend is implemented in Python, utilizing libraries like `numpy` and `pandas` for efficient data manipulation.
- **Database**: A database is not used in this project, as the portal processes and returns the Excel file directly to maintain data protection.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BarisPome/InternshipSummer23-24.git

2. **Install dependencies (ensure you have Python installed):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

- **Upload Excel Files**: Upload an Excel file for processing.
- **File Processing**: The portal will process the file, applying budget control and compliance management checks.
- **Download Processed File**: Once processed, the updated Excel file can be downloaded.

## Impact 
 - **Productivity Gains**: Daily tasks are simplified, allowing employees to focus on more critical work.
 - **Operational Efficiency**: Time for processing Excel files is reduced from 6 hours to 1 minute, significantly enhancing workflow.
 - **Enhanced Reporting**: Offers detailed insights and transparency for budget control and compliance.

## Reflection 

This project was my first experience in web development, and, with no dedicated mentor in the department, I learned many aspects independently. This experience highlighted areas for potential improvement, both in terms of adding new features and refining the technical aspects of the code.
